  - **[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10032629)**: 
  - **Objective**: Development and evaluation of a deepl learning approach, specifically using a U-Net convulutional neural network, for the automated detection of subtle volcanic thermal anomalies in ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) satellite imagery, thereby enhancing global volcano monitoring capabilities.
  - **Methods**:
  - Compiled a dataset of 1,500 labeled ASTER TIR images from five active volcanoes (time-series): Etna (Italy), Popocat√©petl (Mexico), Lascar (Chile), Fuego (Guatemala), and Kliuchevskoi (Russia).
  - Trained a supervised U-Net model to identify thermal anomalies by learning spatial patterns associated with volcanic activity.
  - Validated the model's performance on unseen data, including images from Vulcano Island (Italy), to assess generalization capabilities.
  - **Outcomes**:
  - The U-Net model achieved a detection accuracy of 93%, effectively identifying both prominent and subtle thermal anomalies.
  - Demonstrated the model's ability to generalize across different volcanic settings and activity levels.
  - Highlighted the potential for integrating this approach into global volcanic monitoring systems, especially in remote or inaccessible regions lacking ground-based observations.

  - **Relation to the Project**: This study could be directly relevant to the project if we focuse on detecting anomalies around volcanoes. It provides a robust, automated method for identifying thermal precursors to volcanic activity, which can be instrumental in early warning systems and risk mitigation strategies.
